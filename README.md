# Record Management Software (Python):

A simple command-line based record management system that allows users to create, update, and retrieve personal records stored in text files with date and time tracking.

# Description:

The Record Management Software is a Python-based application designed to help users maintain a personal progress log or record file. Each user can create a uniquely named .txt file where they can continuously add records. Every entry is automatically saved along with the current date and time using the datetime module.The program also checks for existing files using the os module and allows users to retrieve previously saved records. This project focuses on practicing core Python concepts such as file handling, functions, loops, conditional statements, and standard library usage.
